# Azure Fundamentals part 3: Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure

This is the third chapter of the online Microsoft Azure Fundamentals course.

## Choose the best Azure IoT service for your application

IoT bridges the physical and digital worlds by enabling devices with sensors and an internet connection to communicate with cloud-based systems via the internet.

### Identify the IoT options

- IoT enables devices to gather and then relay information for data analysis (most of the time with sensors).
- Azure IoT services has a specific endpoint for devices to send that information.
- It's also possible to manage (updating software/firmware) the devices by Azure.
- Combine this with __Azure AI services__ to predict when machines need maintenance.

There are multiple services that can help you in the AI area on Azure:

- **Azure IoT Hub**: a managed service that's hosted in the cloud and that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages.
  - Supports communications both from the device to the cloud and from the cloud to device.
  - Able to route messages to other Azure services
  - Allows __command and control__ in the cloud to device routing.

- **Azure IoT Central**: builds on top of IoT Hub by adding a dashboard that allows you to connect, monitor, and manage your IoT devices.
  - Has an interface to connect new devices.
  - Watch overall performance and set notifications.
  - Can control devices remotely by interface.
  - Comes with device templates for quick starts (without server-side coding).

- **Azure Sphere**: creates an end-to-end, highly secure IoT solution for customers that encompasses everything from the hardware and operating system on the device to the secure method of sending messages from the device to the message hub. This comes in three parts:
  - The Azure Sphere micro-controller unit (MCU) which can be seen as the motherboard.
  - A customized Linux operating system (OS) for communication with the security service.
  - Azure Sphere Security Service, known as AS3. Checks with certificate-based authentication if the device is not tampered with when connecting to Azure.

  After these parts, the Azure Sphere system can interact with other Azure IoT services by sending telemetry and error information.

### Analyzing the decision criteria for IoT

But how do we determine which IoT service to choose? Most of the decisions come down to the security and if we want an integrated dashboard.

See the following table:
|                   | Dashboard | Security | Dashboard + Security | Nothing |
|-------------------|-----------|----------|----------------------|---------|
| Azure IoT Hub     |           |          |                      |    x    |
| Azure IoT Central |     x     |          |           x          |         |
| Azure Sphere      |           |     x    |           x          |         |

## Choose the best AI service for your needs

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a category of computing that adapts and improves its decision-making ability over time based on its successes and failures. Microsoft Azure provides several AI solutions to choose from, each one depending on the problem you're trying to solve.

### Identify the AI options

- AI is a broad classification of computing that allows a software system to perceive its environment and take action that maximizes its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
- There are two basic approaches for AI:
  - **Deep learning**: Modeled on the neural network of the human mind, enabling it to discover, learn, and grow through experience.
  - **Machine learning**: Data science technique that uses existing data to train a model, test it, and then apply the model to new data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends.

There are three primary products offered by Microsoft:

- **Azure Machine Learning**: Consists of tools and services that allow you to connect to data to train and test models to find one that will most accurately predict a future result. After you've run experiments to test the model, you can deploy and use it in real time via a web API endpoint. Mostly used when you want complete control over the design and training of an algorithm
  - Create a process on how to work with your data (like obtaining and handling missing data).
  - Training and evaluating data.
  - Creating pipelines for running experiments to score algorithms on the defined training/test data.
  - Deploying the algorithm to an API as endpoint.

- **Azure Cognitive Services**: Provides prebuilt machine learning models that enable applications to see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason. While you still need your own data, __Azure Cognitive Services__ comes already with pretrained models.

  There are multiple categories:

  - **Language services**: Process natural language.
  - **Speech services**: Converting speech into text and text into natural-sounding speech.
  - **Vision services**: Adds recognition and identification capabilities for pictures, videos, etc.
  - **Decision services**: More like personalized recommendations that automatically improve each time they are used.

- **Azure Bot Services and Bot Framework**: Platforms for creating virtual agents that understand and reply to questions just like a human. Behind the scenes, the bot you build uses other Azure services, such as Azure Cognitive Services, to understand what their human counterparts are asking for.

### Analyzing the decision criteria for AI

But how do we determine which AI service to choose? There are a few decisions to be made here, like "should it understand images" or "should it create personalized recommendations".

See the following table:
|                          | Connect with Humans | Doing general purpose tasks | Do something never done before |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Azure Machine Learning   |                     |                             |                x               |
| Azure Cognitive Services |                     |              x              |                                |
| Azure Bot Services       |          x          |                             |                                |

---

Extra note on the decision criteria:

- Keep in mind that everything done inside __Azure Cognitive Services__ can be done inside __Azure Machine Learning__.
- Using private historical data (or let's say, big complex models) to recommend stuff to users should always be combined with __Azure Machine Learning__.

## Choose the best Azure serverless technology for your business scenario

Serverless computing is a term used to describe an execution environment that's set up and managed for you. You merely specify what you want to happen by writing code or connecting and configuring components in a visual editor, and then specify the actions that trigger your functionality, such as a timer or an HTTP request. Best of all, you never have to worry about an outage, your code can scale instantly to meet demand, and you pay based only on the actual usage of your code.

### Identify the serverless technology options

- Serverless computing is a cloud-hosted execution environment that runs your code but abstracts the underlying hosting environment.
- There is of course a server by serverless computing, but the main takeaway is that you are not responsible for __setting up__ and __maintaining__ the server.
- Serverless apps are configured to respond to events.
- Scaling and performance are automatically handled and you're only billed for the resources used.

There are two main serverless computing solutions:

- **Azure Functions**: Host a single method or function by using a popular programming language in the cloud that runs in response to an event.
  - Scales automatically and only charged when used.
  - Mostly used when the environment is variable.
  - Azure functions are stateless (they don't remember).
  - Using **Durable Functions**, you can chain functions together while maintaining state.

- **Azure Logic Apps**: Low-code/no-code development platform hosted as a cloud service.
  - Automate and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps, data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations.
  - Build with a web-based designer without writing any code.
  - Link them together with triggers (events such as timers).
  - Choose one of the 200+ connectors when building enterprise integration solutions.
  - Build a connecter yourself if you can't find any.

---

Both look the same, but are certainly different:

- __Azure Functions__ is for serverless computing services and __Azure Logic Apps__ is for serverless orchestration services.
- While __Azure Functions__ pricing is based upon number of executions and running time, __Azure Logic Apps__ is prices based on number of executions and type of connectors.

### Analyzing the decision criteria for Serverless computing

But how do we determine which Serverless computing service to choose? There are a few decisions to be made here, like "custom algorithms" or "do you want to code or follow visual representations".

See the following table:
|                  | Orchestration needed | Custom algorithms | Imperative | Declarative |
|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| Azure Logic Apps |           x          |                   |            |      x      |
| Azure Functions  |                      |         x         |      x     |             |

---

Extra notes:

- **Imperative** stands for writing code.
- **Declarative** stands for creating a visual workflow.

## Choose the best tools to help organizations build better solutions

Modern software development practices are supported by tools that encompass virtually every aspect of the software development life cycle. Microsoft has created a comprehensive set of tools that help organizations implement DevOps practices, develop solutions, and save money while doing so. In this module, you'll learn how to choose the right tools to support those practices.

### Identify the tool options

DevOps is a new approach that helps to align technical teams as they work toward common goals. While this can work if you have the correct tools, your team/company must also follow the principles. But this chapter will only display and go through the different business solutions:

- **Azure DevOps Services**: A suite of services that address every stage of the software development lifecycle.
  - **Azure Repos**: A centralized source-code repository where software development, DevOps engineering, and documentation professionals can publish their code for review and collaboration.
  - **Azure Boards**: An agile project management suite that includes Kanban boards, reporting, and tracking ideas and work from high-level epics to work items and issues.
  - **Azure Pipelines** A CI/CD pipeline automation tool.
  - **Azure Artifacts**: A repository for hosting artifacts, such as compiled source code, which can be fed into testing or deployment pipeline steps.
  - **Azure Test Plans**: An automated test tool that can be used in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure quality before a software release.
- **Github**: A code repository for open-source software.
- **Github Actions**: Enables workflow automation with triggers for many lifecycle events. For example, automating a **CI/CD toolchain**. This is a combination of software tools to elp with the system's development lifecycle. The output of one tool in the toolchain is the input of the next tool in the toolchain.
- **Azure DevTest Labs**: Provides an automated means of managing the process of building, setting up, and tearing down virtual machines (VMs) that contain builds of your software projects.Mostly used so developers and testers can perform tests across a variety of environments and builds (like an older OS system).

---

Notes on choosing between Azure DevOps and Github:

- **GitHub** is lighter-weight and has a long reputation for open-source projects.
- **Azure DevOps** is more focused on enterprise development, with heavier project-management and planning tools, and finer-grained access control.

### Analyzing the decision criteria for the tools

But how do we determine which Serverless computing service to choose? There are a few decisions to be made here, like "open source/closed source" or "how is project managing going to work".

See the following table:
|                    | Open Source | Complexer permission level | Enterprise project management | Integrating third-party tools | Setting up Test Labs |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| GitHub             |      x      |                            |                               |               x               |                      |
| Azure DevOps       |             |              x             |               x               |               x               |                      |
| Azure DevTest Labs |             |                            |                               |                               |           x          |

## Choose the best monitoring service for visibility, insight, and outage mitigation

Modern software systems running in the cloud are complex, and gaining visibility into the health and performance of your application-hosting environment across all of its layers of services is challenging. Fortunately, there are several solutions from Microsoft that can help you react quickly to outages, research intermittent issues, optimize your usage, and be proactive in handling future planned downtime.

### Identify the monitoring tool options

While a company can ask certain questions like "Are we using the cloud correctly?" or "Are we spending more than we need to?" or "Do we have our systems properly secured?", you can use the Azure monitoring to gain your answers.

There are certain choices:

- **Azure Advisor**: Evaluates your Azure resources and makes recommendations to help improve reliability, security, and performance, achieve operational excellence, and reduce costs. It displays personalized recommendations divided into five categories:
  - __Reliability__: Used to ensure and improve the continuity of your business-critical applications.
  - __Security__: Used to detect threats and vulnerabilities that might lead to security breaches.
  - __Performance__: Used to improve the speed of your applications.
  - __Cost__: Used to optimize and reduce your overall Azure spending.
  - __Operational Excellence__: Used to help you achieve process and workflow efficiency, resource manageability, and deployment best practices.
- **Azure Monitor**: A platform for collecting, analyzing, visualizing, and potentially taking action based on the metric and logging data from your entire Azure and on-premises environment. If events are critical, you can for example also notify your team with SMS etc. For more information, see the following picture:
![Overview azure monitoring](Pictures/identify-product-options.png)
- **Azure Service Health**: Provides a personalized view of the health of the Azure services, regions, and resources you rely on. This includes:
  - __Service issues__: Describes problems in Azure that affect you right now (like outages).
  - __Planned maintenance__: Describes what is going to happen and which steps you'll need to undertake (sometimes even rebooting).
  - __Health advisories__: Require you to act to avoid service interruption, including service retirements and breaking changes. Health advisories are announced far in advance to allow you to plan.
If you only want to display the status of Azure, you can use the [status.azure.com](status.azure.com) link.

### Analyzing the decision criteria for the monitoring tools

But how do we determine which Serverless computing service to choose? There are a few decisions to be made here, like "monitoring" or "how should we cut down the costs".

See the following table:
|                      | Improving Azure environment | Monitoring Azure | Improving specific VM or other services | Measure custom events with other usage metrics | Using alerts |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------|
