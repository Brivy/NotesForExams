# Connect your services together

This is the second chapter of the online Azure Developer Associate course.

## Choose a messaging model in Azure to loosely connect your services

Reliable messaging is often a critical problem. That's why Azure has some tools for it.

### Choose whether to use messages or events

There are two kinds of communication strategies:

- **Messages**:
  - Contains data.
  - Does not hold a reference to the data.
  - Expects that the message content is processed in a certain way.
- **Events** (components for sending events are known as *publishers* and *subscribers*):
  - Indicates that something happened.
  - Can be send to multiple receivers or none at all.
  - No expectation about the action a receiving component takes.
  - Some events are unrelated to other events while some of them are part of a related and ordered series.

While events are more likely to be used for broadcasts and are often ephemeral, messages are more likely to be used where the distributed application requires a guarantee that the communication will be processed.

### Choosing a messaging technology

For *messaging* systems, there are two Azure technologies that can be used. They both utilize the idea of a *queue*, which holds sent messages until the target is ready to receive them:

- **Azure Queue Storage** uses Azure Storage to store large numbers of messages that can be securely accessed from anywhere in the world using a simple REST-based interface. Queues can contain millions of messages, limited only by the capacity of the storage account that owns it.

  You should use it when:
  - Need an audit trail of all messages that pass through the queue.
  - Expect the queue to exceed 80 GB in size.
  - Want to track progress for processing a message inside of the queue.

- **Azure Service Bus Queues** is a message broker system intended for enterprise applications. These apps often utilize multiple communication protocols, have different data contracts, higher security requirements, and can include both cloud and on-premises services.

  Another feature of this service are *Azure Service Bus Topics*. Instead of connecting to a single subscriber, you can connect to multiple subscriptions. Because it behaves like a queue, it will only remove the message if all the subscribed branches have processed the message.

  You should use it when:
  - Need an At-Most-Once delivery guarantee.
  - Need a FIFO guarantee.
  - Need to group messages into transactions.
  - Want to receive messages without polling the queue.
  - Need to provide a role-based access model to the queues.
  - Need to handle messages larger than 64 KB but less than 256 KB.
  - Queue size will not grow larger than 80 GB.
  - Want to publish and consume batches of messages.
  - (Topics only) Need multiple receivers to handle each message

Queues have their advantages:

- **Increased reliability**. Because messages are placed inside the queue and don't get removed until they have been read, you can ensure that the message gets processed (even at times of high demand)
- **Message delivery guarantees**. There are three different approaches on how a guarantee delivery can work:
  - *At-Least-Once Delivery*: Each message is guaranteed delivery to at least one of the components that retrieve messages from the queue. But keep in mind that it is possible that the same message may be delivered more than once.
  - *At-Most-Once Delivery*: Each message is not guaranteed for delivery, and there is a small chance that it may not arrive. But there is no chance that the message will be delivered twice. This is sometimes referred to as *automatic duplicate detection*.
  - *First-In-First-Out (FIFO)*: If your distributed application requires that messages are processed in precisely the correct order, you must choose a queue system that includes a FIFO guarantee.

If required, you can put all the messages in a **transaction**. This can avoid problems for when one of the messages isn't received by it's subscriber.

### Choosing an event technology

To start it off, **Azure Event Grid** is a fully-managed event routing service running on top of Azure Service Fabric. It supports most Azure services as a publisher or subscriber and can be used with third-party services. It provides a dynamically scalable, low-cost, messaging system that allows publishers to notify subscribers about a status change.

Event Grid exists from the following concepts:

- **Events**: What happened.
- **Publisher**: The user or organization that decides to send events to Event Grid.
- **Event sources**: Where the event took place. This can be Azure Storage for blob events or IoT Hub for device created events.
- **Topics**: They are represented by a public endpoint and are where the publisher sends events to. There are two kinds of topics:
  - *System topics* are built-in topics provided by Azure services. You don't see system topics in your Azure subscription because the publisher owns the topics, but you can subscribe to them.
  - *Custom topics* are application and third-party topics. When you create or are assigned access to a custom topic, you see that custom topic in your subscription.
- **Event subscriptions**: The endpoint or built-in mechanism to route events, sometimes to multiple handlers. Subscriptions are also used by handlers to filter incoming events intelligently.
- **Event handlers (subscriber)**: The app or service reacting to the event.

An event from the Event Grid is self-contained and can be up to 64KB:

```JSON
[
  {
    "topic": string,
    "subject": string,
    "id": string,
    "eventType": string,
    "eventTime": string,
    "data":{
      object-unique-to-each-publisher
    },
    "dataVersion": string,
    "metadataVersion": string
  }
]
```

Explanation of the JSON properties:

- *topic*: The full resource path to the event source. Event Grid provides this value.
- *subject*: Publisher-defined path to the event subject.
- *id*: The unique identifier for event.
- *eventType*: One of the registered event types for this event source. This is a value you can create filters against, e.g. `CustomerCreated`, `BlobDeleted`, `HttpRequestReceived`, etc.
- *eventTime*: The time the event was generated based on the provider's UTC time.
- *object-unique-to-each-publisher*: Specific information that is relevant to the type of event. For example, an event about a new file being created in Azure Storage has details about the file, such as the lastTimeModified value. Or, an Event Hubs event has the URL of the Capture file. This field is optional.
- *dataVersion*: The schema version of the data object. The publisher defines the schema version.
- *metadataVersion*: The schema version of the event metadata. Event Grid defines the schema of the top-level properties. Event Grid provides this value.

Use Event Grid when you need these features:

- **Simplicity**: It is straightforward to connect sources to subscribers in Event Grid.
- **Advanced filtering**: Subscriptions have close control over the events they receive from a topic.
- **Fan-out**: You can subscribe to an unlimited number of endpoints to the same events and topics.
- **Reliability**: Event Grid retries event delivery for up to 24 hours for each subscription.
- **Pay-per-event**: Pay only for the number of events that you transmit.

You can use Event Grid to deliver discrete events to subscribers, which will receive those events reliably and quickly. But what if we want to deliver a large stream of events? In this scenario, Event Grid isn't a great solution because it's designed for one-event-at-a-time delivery. Instead, we need to turn to another Azure service: **Event Hubs**.

There are some subtle differences between Event Grid and Event Hubs:

- **Partitions** are buffers into which the communications are saved. Event Hubs have at least two partitions and each partition has a separate set of subscribers. A subscriber can "catch up" to these events if they have been busy/offline. After a default time of 24 hours, the message expires.
- **Captures**. Event Hubs can send all your events immediately to Azure Data Lake or Azure Blob storage for inexpensive, permanent persistence.
- **Authentication**. All publishers are authenticated and issued a token. This means Event Hubs can accept events from external devices and mobile apps without worrying.

Event Hubs has support for pipelining event streams to other Azure services. Using it with Azure Stream Analytics, for instance, allows complex analysis of data in near real time, with the ability to correlate multiple events and look for patterns. In this case, Stream Analytics would be considered a subscriber.

You should choose Event Hubs if:

- You need to support authenticating a large number of publishers.
- You need to save a stream of events to Data Lake or Blob storage.
- You need aggregation or analytics on your event stream.
- You need reliable messaging or resiliency.

Otherwise, you should choose Azure Event Grid.
