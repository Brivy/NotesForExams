# Implement CI with Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions

Pipelines.

## Explore Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines is a fully featured service used to create cross-platform CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deployment). It works with your preferred Git provider and can deploy to most major cloud services, including Azure. Azure DevOps offers a comprehensive Pipelines offering.

### Explore the concept of pipelines in DevOps

The goal is to enable a constant flow of changes into production via an automated software production line. Think of it as a pipeline. The pipeline breaks down the software delivery process into stages. Each stage aims to verify the quality of new features from a different angle to validate the new functionality and prevent errors from affecting your users. The pipeline should provide feedback to the team. A delivery pipeline enables the flow of more minor changes more frequently, with a focus on flow. A typical pipeline will include the following stages:

* Build automation and continuous integration.
* Test automation.
* Deployment automation.

### Describe Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines combines continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) to test and build your code and ship it to any target constantly and consistently. Things to consider:

* Many languages are supported with Azure Pipelines, such as Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, C#, and Go.
* Azure Pipelines can integrate with GitHub, GitLab, Azure Repos, Bitbucket, and Subversion.
* Azure Pipelines is compilable with most application types, such as Java, JavaScript, Python, .NET, PHP, Go, XCode, and C++.
* Can deploy to multiple targets like *containers*, *virtual machines*, *azure services*, etc.
* Can publish NuGet, npm, or Maven packages to the built-in package management repository in Azure Pipelines.

The difference between CI and CD is:

| Continuous integration (CI)                      | Continuous delivery (CD)                        |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Increase code coverage.                          | Automatically deploy code to production.        |
| Build faster by splitting test and build runs.   | Ensure deployment targets have the latest code. |
| Automatically ensure you don't ship broken code. | Use tested code from the CI process.            |
| Run tests continually.                           |                                                 |

### Understand Azure Pipelines key terms

A typical pipeline looks like this:

![Cool Picture](Pictures/key-pipeline-concepts-overview-ca80c85c.png)

And the most important terms are:

* **Agent**: When your build or deployment runs, the system begins one or more jobs. An agent is an installable software that runs a build or deployment job.
* **Artifact**: An artifact is a collection of files or packages published by a build. Artifacts are made available for next tasks, such as distribution or deployment.
* **Build**: A build represents one execution of a pipeline. It collects the logs associated with running the steps and the results of running tests.
* **Continuous delivery**: This is a process by which code is built, tested, and deployed to one or more test and production stages.
* **Continuous integration**: This is the practice used by development teams to simplify the testing and building of code.
* **Deployment target**: This is a virtual machine, container, web app, or any service used to host the application being developed.
* **Job**: A build contains one or more jobs. Most jobs run on an agent. A job represents an execution boundary of a set of steps. All the steps run together on the same agent. For example, you might build two configurations - x86 and x64. In this case, you have one build and two jobs.
* **Pipeline**: This defines the continuous integration and deployment process for your app. It's made up of steps called tasks.
* **Release**: This is a term used to describe one execution of a release pipeline. It's made up of deployments to multiple stages.
* **Stage**: They are the primary divisions in a pipeline: "build the app," "run integration tests," and "deploy to user acceptance testing" are good examples of stages.
* **Task**: A building block of a pipeline.
* **Trigger**: Something that's set up to tell the pipeline when to run.

## Manage Azure Pipeline agents and pools

There are differences between Microsoft-hosted and self-hosted agents, detail job types, and introduces agent pools configuration.

### Choose between Microsoft-hosted versus self-hosted agents

To build your code or deploy your software, you generally need at least one agent. There are two types:

* **Microsoft-hosted agent**: If your pipelines are in Azure Pipelines, then you've got a convenient option to build and deploy using a Microsoft-hosted agent. Each time a pipeline is run, a new virtual machine (instance) is provided. The virtual machine is discarded after one use. While maintenance and upgrades are done automatically, this type of job has time limits.
* **Self-hosted agent**: An agent that you set up and manage on your own to run build and deployment jobs is a self-hosted agent. You can use a self-hosted agent in Azure Pipelines. A self-hosted agent gives you more control to install dependent software needed for your builds and deployments. This type of job doesn't have a time limit.

### Explore job types

There are four types of jobs:

* **Agent pool jobs**: The most common types of jobs. The jobs run on an agent that is part of an agent pool.
* **Container jobs**: Similar jobs to Agent Pool Jobs run in a container on an agent part of an agent pool.
* **Deployment group jobs**: Jobs that run on systems in a deployment group.
* **Agentless jobs**: Jobs that run directly on the Azure DevOps. They don't require an agent for execution. It's also-often-called Server Jobs.

### Introduction to agent pools

Instead of managing each agent individually, you organize agents into **agent pools**. An agent pool defines the sharing boundary for all agents in that pool. In Azure Pipelines, pools are scoped to the entire organization so that you can share the agent machines across projects. If you create an Agent pool for a specific project, only that project can use the pool until you add the project pool into another project.

There is also a **pre-defined agent pool** named Azure Pipelines with Microsoft-hosted agents. It will often be an easy way to run jobs without configuring build infrastructure. By default, all contributors in a project are members of the User role on each hosted pool. It allows every contributor to the author and runs build and release pipelines using a Microsoft-hosted pool.

### Understand typical situations for agent pools

If you've got many agents intended for different teams or purposes, you might want to create more pools (the following steps are so good that I wanted to include them here):

* You're a project member, and you want to use a set of machines your team owns for running build and deployment jobs.
  * First, make sure you're a member of a group in *All Pools* with the *Administrator role*.
  * Next, create a *New project agent pool* in your project settings and select the option to *Create a new organization agent pool*. As a result, both an organization and project-level agent pool will be created.
  * Finally, install and configure agents to be part of that agent pool.
* You're a member of the infrastructure team and would like to set up a pool of agents for use in all projects.
  * First, make sure you're a member of a group in *All Pools* with the *Administrator role*.
  * Next, create a New organization agent pool in your admin settings and select Autoprovision corresponding project agent pools in all projects while creating the pool. This setting ensures all projects have a pool pointing to the organization agent pool. The system creates a pool for existing projects, and in the future, it will do so whenever a new project is created.
  * Finally, install and configure agents to be part of that agent pool.
* You want to share a set of agent machines with multiple projects, but not all of them.
  * First, create a project agent pool in one of the projects and select the option to *Create a new organization agent pool* while creating that pool.
  * Next, go to each of the other projects, and create a pool in each of them while selecting the option to Use an existing organization agent pool.
  * Finally, install and configure agents to be part of the shared agent pool.

### Communicate with Azure Pipelines

The agent communicates with Azure Pipelines to determine which job it needs to run and report the logs and job status. It always starts this communication. All the messages from the agent to Azure Pipelines over HTTPS, depending on how you configure the agent.

![Cool Picture](Pictures/agent-machine-behind-firewall-cc762a93.png)

Here's a standard communication pattern between the agent and Azure Pipelines:

* The user registers an agent with Azure Pipelines by adding it to an agent pool. You've to be an **agent pool administrator** to register an agent in that pool. The identity of the agent pool administrator is needed only at the time of registration. Consider generating and using a **PAT** to connect an agent with Azure Pipelines. PAT is the only scheme that works with Azure Pipelines. This PAT is used only when registering the agent and not for succeeding communication.
* Once the registration is complete, the agent downloads a **listener OAuth token** and uses it to listen to the job queue.
* Periodically, the agent checks to see if a new job request has been posted in the job queue in Azure Pipelines. The agent downloads the job and a **job-specific OAuth token** when a job is available. This token is generated by Azure Pipelines for the scoped identity specified in the pipeline. That token is short-lived and is used by the agent to access resources (for example, source code) or modify resources (for example, upload test results) on Azure Pipelines within that job.
* Once the job is completed, the agent **discards the job-specific OAuth token** and checks if there's a new job request using the listener OAuth token.
* The payload of the messages exchanged between the agent, and Azure Pipelines are secured using **asymmetric encryption**. Each agent has a public-private key pair, and the public key is exchanged with the server during registration. The server uses the public key to encrypt the job's payload before sending it to the agent. The agent decrypts the job content using its private key. *Secrets stored in build pipelines, release pipelines, or variable groups are secured when exchanged with the agent*.

### Communicate to deploy to target servers

When you use the agent to deploy artifacts to a set of servers, it must-have "line of sight" connectivity to those servers. The agents must have connectivity to the target on-premises environments and access to the Internet to connect to Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server:

![Cool Picture](Pictures/agents-stages-behind-firewall-ae9c03be.png)

### Examine other considerations

You can run your agent as either a **service** or an **interactive process**. Whether you run an agent as a service or interactively, you can choose which account you use to run the agent. It's *different from your credentials when registering the agent with Azure Pipelines*. The choice of agent account depends solely on the needs of the tasks running in your build and deployment jobs. For example, to run tasks that use Windows authentication to access an external service, you must run the agent using an account with access to that service. As an *interactive process with autologon enabled*, in some cases, you might need to run the agent interactively for production use, such as UI tests. When the agent is configured to run in this mode, the **screen saver is also disabled**.

Microsoft updates the agent software every few weeks in Azure Pipelines. If you run the agent interactively or a newer major version of the agent is available, you must **manually upgrade** the agents. Also, you can do it from the agent pools tab under your project collection or organization. The version of the agent can be viewed with `Azure Pipelines: [https://dev.azure.com/{your_organization}/_admin/_AgentPool](https://dev.azure.com/{your_organization}/_admin/_AgentPool)`.

Self-hosted agents have performance advantages over Microsoft-hosted agents. Specifically on:

* CI build pipelines that don't clean the repo or do a clean build. Microsoft-hosted agents are destroyed after the build or if a release pipeline completes.
* It can sometimes take several minutes for an Microsoft-hosted agent to be allocated, depending on the load on our system.

You can also install multiple self-hosted agents on the same machine. This approach can work well for agents who run jobs that don't consume many shared resources. For example, you could try it for agents that run releases that mostly orchestrate deployments and don't do much work on the agent itself. But it's not always beneficial, for example if you build consumes many disk and I/O resources.

### Describe security of agent pools

In Azure Pipelines, roles are defined on each agent pool. Membership in these roles governs what operations you can do on an agent pool. You have **organization** agent pools and **project agent pools**:

| Role on an organization agent pool | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reader                             | Members of this role can view the organization's agent pool and agents. You typically use it to add operators that are responsible for monitoring the agents and their health.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Service Account                    | Members of this role can use the organization agent pool to create a project agent pool in a project. If you follow the guidelines above for creating new project agent pools, you typically don't have to add any members here.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Administrator                      | Also, with all the above permissions, members of this role can register or unregister agents from the organization's agent pool. They can also refer to the organization agent pool when creating a project agent pool in a project. Finally, they can also manage membership for all roles of the organization agent pool. The user that made the organization agent pool is automatically added to the Administrator role for that pool. |

| Role on an project agent pool | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reader                             | Members of this role can view the project agent pool. You typically use it to add operators responsible for monitoring the build and deployment jobs in that project agent pool.                                      |
| User                               | Members of this role can use the project agent pool when authoring build or release pipelines.                                                                                                                        |

## Describe pipelines and concurrency

Describing parallel jobs and how to estimate their usage.

### Understand parallel jobs

Imagine having one Microsoft-hosted parallel job. When more jobs are triggered, they're queued and will wait for the previous job to finish.

![Cool Picture](Pictures/parallel-job-consumption-8af32918.png)

In this above example, a few cool points are made:

* While the release branch is running, the feature branch is queued.
* When the release branch needs approval, the feature branch will be picked up.
* When approved, the feature branch will first complete before the release branch can continue.

### Estimate parallel jobs

The first limitation is that you only have 1800 free minutes per month. A better rule of thumb is: Estimate that you'll need one parallel job for every four to five users in your organization:

* If you have multiple teams, and if each of them requires a CI build, you'll likely need a parallel job for each team.
* If your CI build trigger applies to multiple branches, you'll likely need a parallel job for each active branch.
* If you develop multiple applications by using one organization or server, you'll likely need more parallel jobs: one to deploy each application simultaneously.

Parallel jobs are purchased at the organization level, and *they're shared by all projects in an organization*. Currently, there isn't a way to partition or dedicate parallel job capacity to a specific project or agent pool. You can check your current organization pipelines under `Organization settings > Pipelines > Parallel jobs` or `https://{your_organization}/_settings/buildqueue?_a=concurrentJobs`.

### Describe Azure Pipelines and open-source projects

You can make your project public so other people can view the contents of that project. They can:

* Browse the code base, download code, view commits, branches, and pull requests.
* View and filter work items.
* View a project page or dashboard.
* View the project Wiki.
* Do a semantic search of the code or work items.

Some other notes:

* Microsoft will automatically apply the free tier limits for public projects if your pipeline is part of an Azure Pipelines public project and your pipeline builds a public repository from GitHub or the same public project in your Azure DevOps organization.
* You can have as many users as you want when you're using Azure Pipelines. There's **no per-user charge** for using Azure Pipelines.
* You can create hundreds or even thousands of definitions for no charge. You can register any number of self-hosted agents for no cost.
* **Visual Studio Enterprise subscriber**s get one self-hosted parallel job in each Azure DevOps Services organization where they're a member.
* If you run builds for more than 14 paid hours in a month, the **per-minute plan** might be less cost-effective than the parallel jobs model.

### Explore Azure Pipelines and Visual Designer

You can create and configure your build and release pipelines in the Azure DevOps web portal with the visual designer. (Often referred to as "Classic Pipelines").

![Cool Picture](Pictures/flowchart-edit-code-94cc665f.png)

This is a good way for new users in continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD).

### Describe Azure Pipelines and YAML

You can configure your pipelines in a YAML file that exists alongside your code.

![Cool Picture](Pictures/flowchart-edit-code-yaml-1e1c3048.png)

It has some benefits over the visual designer:

* The pipeline is versioned with your code and follows the same branching structure. You get validation of your changes through code reviews in pull requests and branch build policies.
* Every branch you use can modify the build policy by adjusting the **azure-pipelines.yml** file.
* A change to the build process might cause a break or result in an unexpected outcome. Because the change is in version control with the rest of your codebase, you can more easily identify the issue.

## Explore continuous integration

**Continuous integration (CI)** is the process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control. The idea is to minimize the cost of integration by making it an early consideration.

### Learn the four pillars of continuous integration

Continuous integration relies on four key elements for successful implementation: 

* **Version Control** manages changes to your source code over time:
  * Git
  * Apache Subversion
  * Team Foundation Version Control
* **Package Management** is used to install, uninstall, and manage software packages:
  * NuGet
  * Node Package Manager (NPM)
  * Chocolatey
  * HomeBrew
  * RPM
* **Continuous Integration** merges all developer working copies to shared mainline several times a day:
  * Azure DevOps
  * TeamCity
  * Jenkins
* **Automated Build Process** creates a software build, including compiling, packaging, and running automated tests:
  * Apache Ant
  * NAnt
  * Gradle

### Explore benefits of continuous integration

Possibly the most essential benefit of continuous integration is **rapid feedback to the developer**. If the developer commits something and breaks the code, they'll know that immediately from the build, unit tests, and other metrics. Other benefits are:

* Improving code quality based on rapid feedback
* Triggering automated testing for every code change
* Reducing build times for quick feedback and early detection of problems (risk reduction)
* Better managing technical debt and conducting code analysis
* Reducing long, complex, and bug-inducing merges
* Increasing confidence in codebase health long before production deployment

### Describe build properties

There are certain build properties that should be known:

* **Build number formatting**: In this case, the date has been retrieved as a system variable, then formatted via yyyyMMdd, and the revision is then appended.

    ![Cool Picture](Pictures/devops-continuous-integration-image-020-cc23bdae.png)

* **Build status**: Sometimes, we don't want builds to run. So we can pause/disable them.

    ![Cool Picture](Pictures/devops-continuous-integration-image-021-e73bc37f.png)

* **Authorization and timeouts**: The authorization scope determines whether the build job is limited to accessing resources in the current project. Or accessing resources in other projects in the project collection.

    ![Cool Picture](Pictures/devops-continuous-integration-image-022-cd0ca433.png)

* **Badges**: Cool pictures.
