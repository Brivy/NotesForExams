# Implement CI with Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions

Pipelines.

## Explore Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines is a fully featured service used to create cross-platform CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deployment). It works with your preferred Git provider and can deploy to most major cloud services, including Azure. Azure DevOps offers a comprehensive Pipelines offering.

### Explore the concept of pipelines in DevOps

The goal is to enable a constant flow of changes into production via an automated software production line. Think of it as a pipeline. The pipeline breaks down the software delivery process into stages. Each stage aims to verify the quality of new features from a different angle to validate the new functionality and prevent errors from affecting your users. The pipeline should provide feedback to the team. A delivery pipeline enables the flow of more minor changes more frequently, with a focus on flow. A typical pipeline will include the following stages:

* Build automation and continuous integration.
* Test automation.
* Deployment automation.

### Describe Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines combines continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) to test and build your code and ship it to any target constantly and consistently. Things to consider:

* Many languages are supported with Azure Pipelines, such as Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, C#, and Go.
* Azure Pipelines can integrate with GitHub, GitLab, Azure Repos, Bitbucket, and Subversion.
* Azure Pipelines is compilable with most application types, such as Java, JavaScript, Python, .NET, PHP, Go, XCode, and C++.
* Can deploy to multiple targets like *containers*, *virtual machines*, *azure services*, etc.
* Can publish NuGet, npm, or Maven packages to the built-in package management repository in Azure Pipelines.

The difference between CI and CD is:

| Continuous integration (CI)                      | Continuous delivery (CD)                        |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Increase code coverage.                          | Automatically deploy code to production.        |
| Build faster by splitting test and build runs.   | Ensure deployment targets have the latest code. |
| Automatically ensure you don't ship broken code. | Use tested code from the CI process.            |
| Run tests continually.                           |                                                 |

### Understand Azure Pipelines key terms

A typical pipeline looks like this:

![Cool Picture](Pictures/key-pipeline-concepts-overview-ca80c85c.png)

And the most important terms are:

* **Agent**: When your build or deployment runs, the system begins one or more jobs. An agent is an installable software that runs a build or deployment job.
* **Artifact**: An artifact is a collection of files or packages published by a build. Artifacts are made available for next tasks, such as distribution or deployment.
* **Build**: A build represents one execution of a pipeline. It collects the logs associated with running the steps and the results of running tests.
* **Continuous delivery**: This is a process by which code is built, tested, and deployed to one or more test and production stages.
* **Continuous integration**: This is the practice used by development teams to simplify the testing and building of code.
* **Deployment target**: This is a virtual machine, container, web app, or any service used to host the application being developed.
* **Job**: A build contains one or more jobs. Most jobs run on an agent. A job represents an execution boundary of a set of steps. All the steps run together on the same agent. For example, you might build two configurations - x86 and x64. In this case, you have one build and two jobs.
* **Pipeline**: This defines the continuous integration and deployment process for your app. It's made up of steps called tasks.
* **Release**: This is a term used to describe one execution of a release pipeline. It's made up of deployments to multiple stages.
* **Stage**: They are the primary divisions in a pipeline: "build the app," "run integration tests," and "deploy to user acceptance testing" are good examples of stages.
* **Task**: A building block of a pipeline.
* **Trigger**: Something that's set up to tell the pipeline when to run.

## Manage Azure Pipeline agents and pools

There are differences between Microsoft-hosted and self-hosted agents, detail job types, and introduces agent pools configuration.

### Choose between Microsoft-hosted versus self-hosted agents

To build your code or deploy your software, you generally need at least one agent. There are two types:

* **Microsoft-hosted agent**: If your pipelines are in Azure Pipelines, then you've got a convenient option to build and deploy using a Microsoft-hosted agent. Each time a pipeline is run, a new virtual machine (instance) is provided. The virtual machine is discarded after one use. While maintenance and upgrades are done automatically, this type of job has time limits.
* **Self-hosted agent**: An agent that you set up and manage on your own to run build and deployment jobs is a self-hosted agent. You can use a self-hosted agent in Azure Pipelines. A self-hosted agent gives you more control to install dependent software needed for your builds and deployments. This type of job doesn't have a time limit.

### Explore job types

There are four types of jobs:

* **Agent pool jobs**: The most common types of jobs. The jobs run on an agent that is part of an agent pool.
* **Container jobs**: Similar jobs to Agent Pool Jobs run in a container on an agent part of an agent pool.
* **Deployment group jobs**: Jobs that run on systems in a deployment group.
* **Agentless jobs**: Jobs that run directly on the Azure DevOps. They don't require an agent for execution. It's also-often-called Server Jobs.

### Introduction to agent pools

Instead of managing each agent individually, you organize agents into **agent pools**. An agent pool defines the sharing boundary for all agents in that pool. In Azure Pipelines, pools are scoped to the entire organization so that you can share the agent machines across projects. If you create an Agent pool for a specific project, only that project can use the pool until you add the project pool into another project.

There is also a **pre-defined agent pool** named Azure Pipelines with Microsoft-hosted agents. It will often be an easy way to run jobs without configuring build infrastructure. By default, all contributors in a project are members of the User role on each hosted pool. It allows every contributor to the author and runs build and release pipelines using a Microsoft-hosted pool.

### Understand typical situations for agent pools

If you've got many agents intended for different teams or purposes, you might want to create more pools (the following steps are so good that I wanted to include them here):

* You're a project member, and you want to use a set of machines your team owns for running build and deployment jobs.
  * First, make sure you're a member of a group in *All Pools* with the *Administrator role*.
  * Next, create a *New project agent pool* in your project settings and select the option to *Create a new organization agent pool*. As a result, both an organization and project-level agent pool will be created.
  * Finally, install and configure agents to be part of that agent pool.
* You're a member of the infrastructure team and would like to set up a pool of agents for use in all projects.
  * First, make sure you're a member of a group in *All Pools* with the *Administrator role*.
  * Next, create a New organization agent pool in your admin settings and select Autoprovision corresponding project agent pools in all projects while creating the pool. This setting ensures all projects have a pool pointing to the organization agent pool. The system creates a pool for existing projects, and in the future, it will do so whenever a new project is created.
  * Finally, install and configure agents to be part of that agent pool.
* You want to share a set of agent machines with multiple projects, but not all of them.
  * First, create a project agent pool in one of the projects and select the option to *Create a new organization agent pool* while creating that pool.
  * Next, go to each of the other projects, and create a pool in each of them while selecting the option to Use an existing organization agent pool.
  * Finally, install and configure agents to be part of the shared agent pool.

### Communicate with Azure Pipelines

The agent communicates with Azure Pipelines to determine which job it needs to run and report the logs and job status. It always starts this communication. All the messages from the agent to Azure Pipelines over HTTPS, depending on how you configure the agent.

![Cool Picture](Pictures/agent-machine-behind-firewall-cc762a93.png)

Here's a standard communication pattern between the agent and Azure Pipelines:

* The user registers an agent with Azure Pipelines by adding it to an agent pool. You've to be an **agent pool administrator** to register an agent in that pool. The identity of the agent pool administrator is needed only at the time of registration. Consider generating and using a **PAT** to connect an agent with Azure Pipelines. PAT is the only scheme that works with Azure Pipelines. This PAT is used only when registering the agent and not for succeeding communication.
* Once the registration is complete, the agent downloads a **listener OAuth token** and uses it to listen to the job queue.
* Periodically, the agent checks to see if a new job request has been posted in the job queue in Azure Pipelines. The agent downloads the job and a **job-specific OAuth token** when a job is available. This token is generated by Azure Pipelines for the scoped identity specified in the pipeline. That token is short-lived and is used by the agent to access resources (for example, source code) or modify resources (for example, upload test results) on Azure Pipelines within that job.
* Once the job is completed, the agent **discards the job-specific OAuth token** and checks if there's a new job request using the listener OAuth token.
* The payload of the messages exchanged between the agent, and Azure Pipelines are secured using **asymmetric encryption**. Each agent has a public-private key pair, and the public key is exchanged with the server during registration. The server uses the public key to encrypt the job's payload before sending it to the agent. The agent decrypts the job content using its private key. *Secrets stored in build pipelines, release pipelines, or variable groups are secured when exchanged with the agent*.

### Communicate to deploy to target servers

When you use the agent to deploy artifacts to a set of servers, it must-have "line of sight" connectivity to those servers. The agents must have connectivity to the target on-premises environments and access to the Internet to connect to Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server:

![Cool Picture](Pictures/agents-stages-behind-firewall-ae9c03be.png)

### Examine other considerations

You can run your agent as either a **service** or an **interactive process**. Whether you run an agent as a service or interactively, you can choose which account you use to run the agent. It's *different from your credentials when registering the agent with Azure Pipelines*. The choice of agent account depends solely on the needs of the tasks running in your build and deployment jobs. For example, to run tasks that use Windows authentication to access an external service, you must run the agent using an account with access to that service. As an *interactive process with autologon enabled*, in some cases, you might need to run the agent interactively for production use, such as UI tests. When the agent is configured to run in this mode, the **screen saver is also disabled**.

Microsoft updates the agent software every few weeks in Azure Pipelines. If you run the agent interactively or a newer major version of the agent is available, you must **manually upgrade** the agents. Also, you can do it from the agent pools tab under your project collection or organization. The version of the agent can be viewed with `Azure Pipelines: [https://dev.azure.com/{your_organization}/_admin/_AgentPool](https://dev.azure.com/{your_organization}/_admin/_AgentPool)`.

Self-hosted agents have performance advantages over Microsoft-hosted agents. Specifically on:

* CI build pipelines that don't clean the repo or do a clean build. Microsoft-hosted agents are destroyed after the build or if a release pipeline completes.
* It can sometimes take several minutes for an Microsoft-hosted agent to be allocated, depending on the load on our system.

You can also install multiple self-hosted agents on the same machine. This approach can work well for agents who run jobs that don't consume many shared resources. For example, you could try it for agents that run releases that mostly orchestrate deployments and don't do much work on the agent itself. But it's not always beneficial, for example if you build consumes many disk and I/O resources.

### Describe security of agent pools

In Azure Pipelines, roles are defined on each agent pool. Membership in these roles governs what operations you can do on an agent pool. You have **organization** agent pools and **project agent pools**:

| Role on an organization agent pool | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Reader                             | Members of this role can view the organization's agent pool and agents. You typically use it to add operators that are responsible for monitoring the agents and their health.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Service Account                    | Members of this role can use the organization agent pool to create a project agent pool in a project.

| Administrator                      | Also, with all the above permissions, members of this role can register or unregister agents from the organization's agent pool. They can also refer to the organization agent pool when creating a project agent pool in a project. Finally, they can also manage membership for all roles of the organization agent pool. The user that made the organization agent pool is automatically added to the Administrator role for that pool. |

| Role on an project agent pool | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
