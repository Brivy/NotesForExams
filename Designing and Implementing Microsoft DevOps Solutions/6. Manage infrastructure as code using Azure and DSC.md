## Explore infrastructure as code and configuration management

Describes key concepts of infrastructure as code and environment deployment creation and configuration. Also, understand the imperative, declarative, and idempotent configuration and how it applies to your company.

### Explore environment deployment

The following table lists the significant differences between manual deployment and infrastructure as code:

| Manual deployment                             | Infrastructure as code                              |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Snowflake servers.                            | A consistent server between environments.           |
| Deployment steps vary by environment.         | Environments are created or scaled easily.          |
| More verification steps and more elaborate manual processes. | Fully automated creation of environment updates. |
| Increased documentation to account for differences. | Transition to immutable infrastructure.        |
| Deployment on weekends to allow time to recover from errors. | Use blue/green deployments.           |
| Slower release cadence to minimize pain and long weekends. | Treat servers as cattle, not pets.        |

And here is a great list of benefits:

* Promotes auditing by making it easier to trace what was deployed, when, and how. (In other words, it improves traceability.)
* Provides consistent environments from release to release.
* Greater consistency across development, test, and production environments.
* Automates scale-up and scale-out processes.
* Allows configurations to be version-controlled.
* Provides code review and unit-testing capabilities to help manage infrastructure changes.
* Uses immutable service processes, meaning if a change is needed to an environment, a new service is deployed, and the old one was taken down; it isn't updated.
* Allows blue/green (A/B) deployments.
* Treats infrastructure as a flexible resource that can be provisioned, de-provisioned, and reprovisioned as and when needed.

### Examine environment configuration

**Configuration management** refers to automated configuration management, typically in version-controlled scripts, for an application and all the environments needed to support it. Here are some differences between manual configuration and configuration as code:

| Manual configuration                         | Configuration as code                             |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Configuration bugs are challenging to identify. | Bugs are easily reproducible.                  |
| Error-prone.                                  | Consistent configuration.                      |
| More verification steps and more elaborate manual processes. | Increase deployment cadence to reduce the amount of incremental change. |
| Increased documentation.                      | Treat environment and configuration as executable documentation. |
| Deployment on weekends to allow time to recover from errors. |  |
| Slower release cadence to minimize the requirement for long weekends. |  |

And again, some benefits:

* Bugs are more easily reproduced, audit help, and improve traceability.
* Provides consistency across environments such as dev, test, and release.
* It increased deployment cadence.
* Less documentation is needed and needs to be maintained as all configuration is available in scripts.
* Enables automated scale-up and scale out.
* Allows version-controlled configuration.
* Helps detect and correct configuration drift.
* Provides code-review and unit-testing capabilities to help manage infrastructure changes.
* Treats infrastructure as a flexible resource.
* Promotes automation.

### Understand imperative versus declarative configuration

There are a few different approaches that you can adopt to implement Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code:

* **Declarative** (functional). The declarative approach states what the final state should be. When run, the script or definition will initialize or configure the machine to have the finished state declared without defining how that final state should be achieved.

* **Imperative** (procedural). In the imperative approach, the script states the how for the final state of the machine by executing the steps to get to the finished state. It defines what the final state needs to be but also includes how to achieve that final state. It also can consist of coding concepts such as for, *if-then, loops, and matrices.

  ![Cool picture](Pictures/imperative-a9e6a2ad.png)

A declarative approach would *generally* be the preferred option where ease of use is the primary goal. Azure Resource Manager template files are an example of a declarative automation approach.

An imperative approach may have some advantages in complex scenarios where changes in the environment occur relatively frequently, which need to be accounted for in your code.

### Understand idempotent configuration

**Idempotence** is a mathematical term that can be used in Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code. It can apply one or more operations against a resource, resulting in the same outcome.

You can achieve idempotency by:

* Automatically configuring and reconfiguring an existing set of resources.
* Discarding the existing resources and recreating a new environment.

## Create Azure resources using Azure Resource Manager templates

Using Azure Resource Manager templates and their components and details dependencies and modularized templates with secrets.

### Why use Azure Resource Manager templates?

Using **Resource Manager templates** will make your deployments faster and more repeatable. Some benefits:

* Templates **improve consistency**. Resource Manager templates provide a common language for you and others to describe your deployments.
* Templates help **express complex deployments**. Resource Manager maps out each resource and its dependent resources and creates dependent resources first. Dependency mapping helps ensure that the deployment is carried out in the correct order.
* Templates **reduce manual, error-prone tasks**.
* Templates are **code**. The template code documents the deployment. Also, most users maintain their templates under revision control, such as GIT.
* Templates **promote reuse**. Your template can contain parameters that are filled in when the template runs. They also enable you to create multiple versions of your infrastructure, such as staging and production, while still using the same template.
* Templates are **linkable**. You can link Resource Manager templates together to make the templates themselves modular. You can write small templates that define a solution and then combine them to create a complete system.

### Explore template components

A Resource Manager template can contain sections that are expressed using JSON notation but aren't related to the JSON language itself:

**Parameters** are where you specify which values are configurable when the template runs. Here's an example that illustrates two parameters: one for a virtual machine's (VMs) username and one for its password:

```JSON
"parameters": {
  "adminUsername": {
    "type": "string",
    "metadata": {
      "description": "Username for the Virtual Machine."
    }
  },
  "adminPassword": {
    "type": "securestring",
    "metadata": {
      "description": "Password for the Virtual Machine."
    }
  }
}
```

**Variables** are where you define values that are used throughout the template. Here's an example that illustrates a few variables that describe networking features for a VM:

```JSON
"variables": {
  "nicName": "myVMNic",
  "addressPrefix": "10.0.0.0/16",
  "subnetName": "Subnet",
  "subnetPrefix": "10.0.0.0/24",
  "publicIPAddressName": "myPublicIP",
  "virtualNetworkName": "MyVNET"
}
```

**Functions** are where you define procedures that you don't want to repeat throughout the template. Here's an example that creates a function for creating a unique name to use when creating resources that have globally unique naming requirements:

```JSON
"functions": [
  {
    "namespace": "contoso",
    "members": {
      "uniqueName": {
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "namePrefix",
            "type": "string"
          }
        ],
        "output": {
          "type": "string",
          "value": "[concat(toLower(parameters('namePrefix')), uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]"
        }
      }
    }
  }
],
```

**Resources** are where you define the Azure resources that make up your deployment. Here's an example that creates a public IP address resource:

```JSON
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses",
  "name": "[variables('publicIPAddressName')]",
  "location": "[parameters('location')]",
  "apiVersion": "2018-08-01",
  "properties": {
    "publicIPAllocationMethod": "Dynamic",
    "dnsSettings": {
      "domainNameLabel": "[parameters('dnsLabelPrefix')]"
    }
  }
}
```

**Outputs** are where you define any information you'd like to receive when the template runs. Here's an example that illustrates an output named hostname. The FQDN value is read from the VM's public IP address settings:

```JSON
"outputs": {
  "hostname": {
    "type": "string",
    "value": "[reference(variables('publicIPAddressName')).dnsSettings.fqdn]"
  }
}
```

### Manage dependencies

For any given resource, other resources might need to exist before you can deploy the resource. You define a dependency with the **dependsOn** element or by using the **reference** function. It will validate if this is possible or that you have a **circular dependency**. If so, it can't deploy the resources.

The *dependsOn* value can be a comma-separated list of resource names.

![Cool picture](Pictures/dependson-e5a30e56.png)

Some notes:

* You only need to define dependencies for resources that are deployed in the same template.
* When resources aren't dependent on each other, the Resource Manager deploys them in parallel.

### Modularize templates

When using Azure Resource Manager templates, it's best to modularize them by breaking them into individual components. The primary methodology to use is by using **linked templates**:

```JSON
"resources": [
  {
      "apiVersion": "2017-05-10",
      "name": "linkedTemplate",
      "type": "Microsoft.Resources/deployments",
      "properties": {
          "mode": "Incremental",
          <link-to-external-template>
      }
  }
]
```

Then there is also the **nested template**, where you can nest the template within the main template, use the template property, and specify the template syntax.

```JSON
"resources": [
  {
    "apiVersion": "2017-05-10",
    "name": "nestedTemplate",
    "type": "Microsoft.Resources/deployments",
    "properties": {
      "mode": "Incremental",
      "template": {
        "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
        "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
        "resources": [
          {
            "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
            "name": "[variables('storageName')]",
            "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
            "location": "West US",
            "properties": {
              "accountType": "Standard_LRS"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

**Note** that in nested templates, you can't use parameters or variables defined within the nested template itself for nested templates. You can only use parameters and variables from the main template.

### Deploying templates

When **deploying** your resources using templates, you have three options:

* **validate**. This option compiles the templates, validates the deployment, ensures the template is functional (for example, no circular dependencies), and correct syntax.
* **incremental mode** (default). This option only deploys whatever is defined in the template. It doesn't remove or modify any resources that aren't defined in the template (in comparison to "complete mode").
* **complete mode**: Resource Manager deletes resources that exist in the resource group but isn't specified in the template. For example, only resources defined in the template will be present in the resource group after the template deploys. As a best practice, use this mode for production environments to achieve idempotency in your deployment templates.

More notes:

* As a best practice, use one resource group per deployment.
* You can only use `incremental` deployment mode for both linked and nested templates.

### External template and external parameters

To link to an external template and parameter file, use **templateLink** and **parametersLink**. Some thoughts:

* When linking to a template, ensure that the Resource Manager service can access it.
* You can only provide a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) value that includes HTTP or HTTPS.
* One option is to place your linked template in a storage account and use the URI for that item.
* To make the template private, you can add your template to a private storage account accessible to only the storage account owner, creating shared access signature (SAS) tokens to enable access during deployment.

It will look something like this:

```JSON
"resources": [
    {
      "name": "linkedTemplate",
      "type": "Microsoft.Resources/deployments",
      "apiVersion": "2018-05-01",
      "properties": {
          "mode": "Incremental",
          "templateLink": {
              "uri":"https://linkedtemplateek1store.blob.core.windows.net/linkedtemplates/linkedStorageAccount.json?sv=2018-03-28&sr=b&sig=dO9p7XnbhGq56BO%2BSW3o9tX7E2WUdIk%2BpF1MTK2eFfs%3D&se=2018-12-31T14%3A32%3A29Z&sp=r"
          },
          "parameters": {
              "storageAccountName":{"value": "[variables('storageAccountName')]"},
              "location":{"value": "[parameters('location')]"}
          }
      }
    },
```
