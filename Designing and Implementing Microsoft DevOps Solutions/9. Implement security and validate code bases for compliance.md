## Introduction to Secure DevOps

DevSecOps incorporates the security team and their capabilities into your DevOps practices making security the responsibility of everyone on the team. Security needs to shift from an afterthought to being evaluated at every process step.

### Describe SQL injection attack

### Understand DevSecOps

Secure DevOps includes these traditional security methodologies and more. With Secure DevOps, security is about securing the pipeline. It involves determining where to add protection to the elements that plug into your build and release pipelines.

It also addresses broader questions, such as:

* Is my pipeline consuming third-party components, and are they secure?
* Are there known vulnerabilities within any of the third-party software we use?
* How quickly can I detect vulnerabilities (also called time to detect)?
* How quickly can I remediate identified vulnerabilities (also known as time to remediate)?

### Explore Secure DevOps Pipeline

Two essential features of Secure DevOps Pipelines that aren't found in standard DevOps Pipelines are:

* Package management and the approval process associated with it. The workflow diagram details other steps for adding software packages to the Pipeline and the approval processes that packages must go through before they're used. These steps should be enacted early in the Pipeline to identify issues sooner in the cycle.
* Source Scanner is also an extra step for scanning the source code. This step allows for security scanning and checking for vulnerabilities that aren't present in the application code. The scanning occurs after the app is built before release and pre-release testing. Source scanning can identify security vulnerabilities earlier in the cycle.

## Implement open-source software

Explores open-source software and corporate concerns with software components.

### What is open-source software

Wikipedia defines open-source software as follows:

*Open-source software is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.*

Being responsible for the source code used in components used within a company means that you must accept its risks. The concerns are that source code component:

* ... are of low quality. It would impact the maintainability, reliability, and performance of the overall solution.
* ... have no active maintenance. The code wouldn't evolve or be alterable without copying the source code, effectively forking away from the origin.
* ... contain malicious code. The entire system that includes and uses the code will be compromised. Potentially the whole company's IT and infrastructure is affected.
* ... have security vulnerabilities. The security of a software system is as good as its weakest part. Using source code with vulnerabilities makes the entire system susceptible to attack by hackers and misuse.
* ... have unfavorable licensing restrictions. The effect of a license can affect the entire solution that uses the open-source software.

### Introduction to open-source licenses

A license describes how the source code and the components built from it can be used and how any software created with it should deal with it. According to the open-source definition of OpenSource.org, a license shouldn't:

* Discriminate against persons or groups.
* Discriminate against fields of endeavor.
* Be specific to a product.
* Restrict other software.
* And more - See the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd/).

There are a couple of different types of licenses:

![Cool picture](Pictures/2-3-license-spectrum-2ef17187.png)

The following list describes the most common licenses shown in the diagram:

1. **BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)**
   * *Description*: A permissive license with minimal restrictions on use, modification, and distribution. It allows for proprietary use and doesn't require disclosure of source code.
   * *When to use*: When you want to allow others to use your code with minimal restrictions and don't require sharing of modifications.
2. **MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)**
   * *Description*: A permissive license similar to the BSD license, with fewer conditions. It allows for proprietary use and doesn't require disclosure of source code.
   * *When to use*: When you want a simple, permissive license that allows others to use, modify, and distribute your code with minimal restrictions.
3. **Apache License 2.0**
   * *Description*: A permissive license that allows for proprietary use, modification, and distribution of software. It includes explicit patent and trademark protection provisions.
   * *When to use*: When you want to allow others to use your code with minimal restrictions and provide patent and trademark protection.
4. **MPL (Mozilla Public License)**
   * *Description*: A weak copyleft license that requires modifications to the licensed code to be released under the same license, but allows for proprietary use of unmodified code.
   * *When to use*: When you want to encourage sharing of modifications to your code while allowing proprietary use of the unmodified code.
5. **EPL (Eclipse Public License)**
   * *Description*: A weak copyleft license similar to the MPL that requires modifications to the licensed code to be released under the same license, but allows for proprietary use of unmodified code.
   * *When to use*: When you want to encourage sharing of modifications to your code while allowing proprietary use of the unmodified code, and when working on projects related to the Eclipse ecosystem.
6. **MS-RL (Microsoft Reciprocal License)**
   * *Description*: A weak copyleft license that requires modifications to the licensed code to be released under the same license, but allows for proprietary use of unmodified code.
   * *When to use*: When you want to encourage sharing of modifications to your code while allowing proprietary use of the unmodified code, and when working on projects related to the Microsoft ecosystem.
7. **GPL (GNU General Public License)**
   * *Description*: A strong copyleft license that requires any derived works to be released under the same license, ensuring that modifications and improvements are also open source.
   * *When to use*: When you want to ensure that any modifications or improvements to your code are also open source and freely available.
8. **LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License)**
   * *Description*: A weaker version of the GPL that allows for linking with proprietary software, while still requiring any changes to the LGPL-licensed code to be released under the same license.
   * *When to use*: When you want to allow your code to be used in proprietary software, but still require any modifications to the LGPL-licensed code to be open source.
9. **AGPL (GNU Affero General Public License)**
   * *Description*: A strong copyleft license similar to the GPL, with an additional requirement that if the software is used over a network, users must have access to the source code.
   * *When to use*: When you want to ensure that any modifications or improvements to your code are also open source, and when you want to require that users accessing the software over a network have access to the source code.

## Software Composition Analysis

Explains Composition Analysis, inspecting and validating code bases for compliance, integration with security tools, and integration with Azure Pipelines.

### Explore software composition analysis

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a set of tools that provides visibility into the open-source components used in your software. It helps you identify and remediate security and compliance issues in your code base. There are two SCA tools that are being described:

* [WhiteSource](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/):
  * It can be integrated into Azure Pipelines to provide visibility into the open-source components used in your software.
  * It can automatically generate an alert and provides targeted remediation guidance when a new security vulnerability is discovered.
  * If configured, it can automatically approves, rejects, or triggers a manual approval process every time a new open-source component is added to a build.
* [Github Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/):
  * It can create a notification for when:
    * A new vulnerability is added to the GitHub Advisory database.
    * A new vulnerability data from Mend is processed.
    * A dependency graph for a repository changes.
  * A key advantage of Dependabot security updates is that they can automatically create pull requests.

### Integrate software composition analysis checks into pipelines

Azure Marketplace extensions that help integrate software composition analysis checks during PRs include:

* **Mend**. Helps validate dependencies with its binary fingerprinting.
* **Checkmarx**. Provides an incremental scan of changes.
* **Veracode**. Implements the concept of a developer sandbox.
* **Black Duck by Synopsis**. An auditing tool for open-source code to help identify, fix, and manage compliance.

Here is a simple diagram of how the SCA tools can be integrated into the pipeline:

![Cool picture](Pictures/workflow-diagram-build-definition-7149d684.png)

To correctly interpret the results of scanning tools, you need to be aware of some aspects:

* **False positives**: It's essential to verify the findings to be real positives in the scan results. The tooling is an automated way to scan and might be misinterpreting specific vulnerabilities. In the triaging of the finding in the scan results, you should be aware that some findings might not be correct. Such results are called false positives, established by human interpretation and expertise. One must not declare a result a false positive too quickly. On the other hand, scan results aren't guaranteed to be 100% accurate.
* **Security bug bar**: Most likely, many security vulnerabilities will be detected—some of these false positives, but still many findings. More findings can often be handled or mitigated, given a certain amount of time and money. In such cases, there must be a security bug bar indicating the level of vulnerabilities that must be fixed before the security risks are acceptable enough to take the software into production. The bug bar makes sure that it's clear what must be taken care of and what might be done if time and resources are left.

## Static analyzers

Static analyzers SonarCloud and CodeQL in GitHub.

### Explore static analyzers

**SonarCloud** is a cloud-based platform that provides continuous code quality management to developers. It offers a range of tools for static code analysis, code coverage, code duplication detection, and other quality metrics. By integrating with popular CI/CD tools, SonarCloud helps developers to automatically identify and fix code issues as they occur, enabling them to deliver higher-quality code faster.

Developers use **CodeQL** to automate security checks. It treats code like data that can be queried. GitHub and community researchers have contributed standard CodeQL queries, and you can write your own. A CodeQL analysis consists of three phases:

* Creating a CodeQL database (based upon the code).
* Run CodeQL queries against the database.
* Interpret the results.

**Binskim** is a binary code analysis tool developed by Microsoft that helps detect potential security issues in Windows binaries. It is designed to analyze compiled binaries and identify various security vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, integer overflows, and type confusion. Binskim can be integrated into your build process and can be used to perform security testing during development or as part of a regular security audit.

## OWASP and Dynamic Analyzers

OWASP and Dynamic Analyzers for penetration testing, results, and bugs.

### OWASP stuff

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a global charitable organization focused on improving software security. It's mission is to make software security visible so that individuals and organizations can make informed decisions.

Checkout OWASP ZAP; it's a free, open-source penetration testing tool being used for security testing of web applications. It can be used for finding security vulnerabilities in web applications during the development and testing phase. It can also be used as a proxy server to simulate an attack on a web application by a malicious user.

## Security Monitoring and Governance

Security monitoring and governance with **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and its usage scenarios, Azure Policies, Microsoft Defender for Identity, and security practices related to the tools.

### Implement pipeline security

There are some operational security practices that can be implemented to improve the security of the pipeline:

* Authentication  and authorization.
* CI/CD Release Pipeline.
* Permissions management.
* Dynamic scanning (the process of testing the running application with known attack patterns).
* Production monitoring.

But the most important one is that you make use of **Azure Resource Manager Templates** or other code-based configurations. Implement IaC best practices, such as making changes in templates to make changes traceable and repeatable.

### Explore Microsoft Defender for Cloud

**Microsoft Defender for Cloud** is a monitoring service that provides threat protection across all your services both in Azure and on-premises:

* Provide security recommendations based on your configurations, resources, and networks.
* Monitor security settings across on-premises and cloud workloads and automatically apply required security to new services as they come online.
* Continuously monitor all your services and do automatic security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
* Use *Azure Machine Learning* to detect and block malicious software from being installed on your virtual machines (VMs) and services. You can also define a list of allowed applications to ensure that only the validated apps can execute.
* Analyze and identify potential inbound attacks and help investigate threats and any post-breach activity that might have occurred.
* Provide just-in-time (JIT) access control for ports by reducing your attack surface by ensuring the network only allows traffic that you require.

While it is both available on Windows and Linux, different price tiers exists:

* **Free**. Available as part of your Azure subscription, this tier is limited to assessments and Azure resources' recommendations only.
* **Standard**. This tier provides a full suite of security-related services, including continuous monitoring, threat detection, JIT access control for ports, and more.

### Examine Microsoft Defender for Cloud usage scenarios

Many organizations only respond to security incidents after an attack has occurred. To reduce costs and damage, it's necessary to have an incident response plan before an attack occurs:

* **Detect**. Review the first indication of an event investigation. For example, use the Microsoft Defender for Cloud dashboard to review a high-priority security alert's initial verification.
* **Assess**. Do the initial assessment to obtain more information about suspicious activity. For example, you can get more information about a security alert from Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
* **Diagnose**. Conduct a technical investigation and identify containment, mitigation, and workaround strategies. For example, you can follow the remediation steps described by Microsoft Defender for Cloud for a particular security alert.
* Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations to enhance security.

Also, by using security policies in combination with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can ensure that your resources are configured correctly and that they stay compliant with your corporate standards and service-level agreements (SLAs).

### Explore Azure Policy

**Azure Policy** is an Azure service that you can create, assign, and manage policies. Policies enforce different rules and effects over your Azure resources, ensuring that your resources stay compliant with your standards and SLAs:

* It uses policies and initiatives to provide policy enforcement capabilities.
* It evaluates your resources by scanning for resources that don't follow the policies you create.
* It can help maintain the state of your resources by evaluating your existing resources and configurations and automatically remediating non-compliant resources.
* It has built-in policy and initiative definitions for you to use. The definitions are arranged into categories: Storage, Networking, Compute, Security Center, and Monitoring.

It can also integrate with Azure DevOps by applying any continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipeline policies that apply to the pre-deployment and post-deployment of your applications. The **Check Gate task** is an example of an Azure policy that you can integrate with your DevOps CI/CD pipeline. It provides security and compliance assessment on the resources with an Azure resource group or subscription that you can specify. Check gate is available as a Release pipeline deployment task.

### Understand policies

To work with policies, you first need to create a **policy definition**. This specifies the resources to be evaluated and the actions to take on them. An example such a definition:

```JSON
{
    "properties": {
        "mode": "all",
        "parameters": {
            "allowedLocations": {
                "type": "array",
                "metadata": {
                    "description": "The list of locations that can be specified when deploying resources",
                    "strongType": "location",
                    "displayName": "Allowed locations"
                }
            }
        },
        "displayName": "Allowed locations",
        "description": "This policy enables you to restrict the locations your organization can specify when deploying resources.",
        "policyRule": {
            "if": {
                "not": {
                    "field": "location",
                    "in": "[parameters('allowedLocations')]"
                }
            },
            "then": {
                "effect": "deny"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Some examples of policy definitions are:

* Allowed Storage Account SKUs (Deny): Determines if a storage account being deployed is within a set of SKU sizes. Its effect is to deny all storage accounts that don't adhere to the set of defined SKU sizes.
* Allowed Resource Type (Deny): Defines the resource types that you can deploy. Its effect is to deny all resources that aren't part of this defined list.
* Allowed Locations (Deny): Restricts the available locations for new resources. Its effect is used to enforce your geo-compliance requirements.
* Allowed Virtual Machine SKUs (Deny): Specify a set of virtual machine SKUs you can deploy.
* Add a tag to resources (Modify): Applies a required tag and its default value if the deploy request does not specify it.
* Not allowed resource types (Deny): Prevents a list of resource types from being deployed.

With our new definition, we can **assign the policy** it to a specific scope. copes can range from a management group to a resource group. Remember: **Child resources will inherit any policy assignments applied to their parents**. It means if a policy is applied to a resource group, it's used to all the resources within that resource group. However, you can define *subscopes* for excluding resources from policy assignments.

Lastly, we have **remediation**. Here you should review the policy evaluation results and address any non-compliances. Resources found not to follow a *deployIfNotExists* or *modify* policy condition can be put into a compliant state through Remediation. It instructs Azure Policy to run the deployIfNotExists effect or the tag operations of the policy on existing resources.

### Explore initiatives

**Initiatives** work alongside policies in Azure Policy. An *initiative definition* is a set of policy definitions to help track your compliance state for meeting large-scale compliance goals. Applying an initiative definition to a specific scope is called an *initiative assignment*.

Initiative definitions simplify the process of managing and assigning policy definitions by grouping sets of policies into a single item. For example, you can create an initiative named *Enable Monitoring* in Azure Security Center to monitor security recommendations from Azure Security Center.

Under this example initiative, you would have the following policy definitions:

* Monitor unencrypted SQL Database in Security Center. This policy definition monitors unencrypted SQL databases and servers.
* Monitor OS vulnerabilities in Security Center. This policy definition monitors servers that don't satisfy a specified OS baseline configuration.
* Monitor missing Endpoint Protection in Security Center. This policy definition monitors servers without an endpoint protection agent installed.

And like a policy assignment, an initiative assignment is an initiative definition assigned to a specific scope.

### Explore resource locks

**Locks** help you prevent accidental deletion or modification of your Azure resources. You can manage locks from within the Azure portal. You can set a lock level to:

* **CanNotDelete** means that authorized users can read and modify a resource, but they can't delete it.
* **ReadOnly** means that authorized users can read a resource, but they can't modify or delete it.

### Explore Azure Blueprints

**Azure Blueprints** enables cloud architects to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implement and adhere to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. It helps development teams build and deploy new environments rapidly with a set of built-in components that speed up development and delivery and it's done while staying within organizational compliance requirements.

It provides a declarative way to orchestrate deployment for various resource templates and artifacts, including:

* Role assignments
* Policy assignments
* Azure Resource Manager templates
* Resource groups

Important to keep in mind that the blueprints in Azure Blueprints are different from Azure Resource Manager templates.

When *Azure Resource Manager* templates deploy resources, they have no active relationship with the deployed resources. They exist in a local environment or source control. By contrast, with *Azure Blueprints*, each deployment is tied to an Azure Blueprints package. It means that the relationship with resources will be maintained, even after deployment. This way, keeping relationships improves deployment tracking and auditing capabilities.

In summary, while both Azure Resource Manager and Azure Blueprints are used for managing Azure resources, they serve different scopes. ARM is for managing specific resources, while Blueprints allow for the management of collections of resources with additional governance and compliance features.

### Understand Microsoft Defender for Identity

Microsoft Defender for Identity (formerly Azure Advanced Threat Protection, also known as Azure ATP) is a cloud-based security solution that identifies and detects:

* Advanced threats.
* Compromised identities.
* Malicious insider actions directed at your organization.

Microsoft Defender consists of the following components:

* **Microsoft Defender** has its portal. You can monitor and respond to suspicious activity through the Microsoft Defender portal. The Microsoft Defender portal allows you to manage your Microsoft Defender instance and review data received from Microsoft Defender sensors.
* **Microsoft Defender sensors** are installed directly on your domain controllers. The sensors monitor domain controller traffic without requiring a dedicated server or port mirroring configurations.
* **The Microsoft Defender cloud service** runs on the Azure infrastructure and is deployed in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The Microsoft Defender cloud service is connected to the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph.

You also have **Microsoft Defender for Containers** at the subscription level. Once it's enabled:

* Microsoft Defender will then scan images that are pushed to the registry.
* Scan imported into the registry.
* Or any images pulled within the last 30 days.

There's a per-image charge for this feature. When issues are found, a notification appears in the Microsoft Defender dashboard. There are three triggers for image scans:

* On push (a new image is pushed to the registry)
* Recently pulled (any image pulled in the last 30 days)
* On import (when an image is imported from other locations like Docker Hub)
