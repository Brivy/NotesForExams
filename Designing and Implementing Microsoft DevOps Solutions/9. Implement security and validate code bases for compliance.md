Infrastructure and configuration strategy and appropriate toolset for a release pipeline and application infrastructure. What do you want more?

## Introduction to Secure DevOps

DevSecOps incorporates the security team and their capabilities into your DevOps practices making security the responsibility of everyone on the team. Security needs to shift from an afterthought to being evaluated at every process step.

### Understand DevSecOps

Secure DevOps includes these traditional security methodologies and more. With Secure DevOps, security is about securing the pipeline. It involves determining where to add protection to the elements that plug into your build and release pipelines.

It also addresses broader questions, such as:

* Is my pipeline consuming third-party components, and are they secure?
* Are there known vulnerabilities within any of the third-party software we use?
* How quickly can I detect vulnerabilities (also called time to detect)?
* How quickly can I remediate identified vulnerabilities (also known as time to remediate)?

### Explore Secure DevOps Pipeline

Two essential features of Secure DevOps Pipelines that aren't found in standard DevOps Pipelines are:

* Package management and the approval process associated with it. The workflow diagram details other steps for adding software packages to the Pipeline and the approval processes that packages must go through before they're used. These steps should be enacted early in the Pipeline to identify issues sooner in the cycle.
* Source Scanner is also an extra step for scanning the source code. This step allows for security scanning and checking for vulnerabilities that aren't present in the application code. The scanning occurs after the app is built before release and pre-release testing. Source scanning can identify security vulnerabilities earlier in the cycle.
