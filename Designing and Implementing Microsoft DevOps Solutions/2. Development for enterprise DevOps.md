# Development for enterprise DevOps

Gotta use the cool Git features for enterprise stuff.

## Structure your Git Repo

While there's no one way to implement Git in the right way, many techniques can help you scale the implementation of Git across the organization.

### Explore monorepo versus multiple repos

There are two philosophies on organizing your repos: Monorepo or Multiple repos.

* **Monorepos** is a source control pattern where all the source code is kept in a single repository. It's super simple to give all your employee's access to everything in one shot. Just clone it down and done.
* **Multiple repositories** refer to organizing your projects each into their separate repository.

The *multiple repos view*, in extreme form, is that if you let every subteam live in its repo. They have the flexibility to work in their area however they want, using whatever libraries, tools, development workflow, and so on, **will maximize their productivity**. The drawbacks are also the same as the advantages, people use different languages, tools, workflows. Bugs need to be found in the appropriate repository etc. 

The *monorepo view* the friction, especially when dealing with more complicated dependency graphs, is much more costly than multiple repos advocates recognize. While some teams may find a locally optimal way of working, it may be the case. It's also likely that other teams will offset their gains by choosing a suboptimal way of working.

### Implement a change log

It's a file that has a list of changes made to a project, usually in date order. The typical breakdown is to separate a list of versions, and then within each version, show:

* Added features
* Modified/Improved features
* Deleted features

There are some commands/tools for this stuff:

* Using native GitHub commands. See also the command `git log [options] vX.X.X..vX.X.Y | helper-script > projectchangelogs/X.X.Y`
* [Git changelog](https://pypi.org/project/gitchangelog/). A tool based on Python.
* [GitHub changelog generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator). A tool based on Gem (ruby). Running `github_changelog_generator -u github-changelog-generator -p TimerTrend-3.0` will generate some logs.

## Manage Git branches and workflows

Exploring Git branching types, concepts, and models for the continuous delivery process. It helps companies define their branching strategy and organization.

### Explore branch workflow types

You want the workflow to enhance your team's effectiveness and not be a burden that limits productivity. Some things to consider when evaluating a Git workflow are:

* Does this workflow scale with team size?
* Is it easy to undo mistakes and errors with this workflow?
* Does this workflow impose any new unnecessary cognitive overhead on the team?

### Explore feature branch workflow

The core idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the main branch. It also means the main branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments.

The **trunk-based development Workflow** assumes a central repository, and the main represents the official project history. Changes you make on a branch don't affect the main branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with. There's only one rule: anything in the main branch is always deployable.

While the learning material tries to give you an example of the **GitHub flow**, it's exactly like the trunk-based development Workflow. In short, the steps are as follows:

* Create a branch
* Add commits
* Open a pull request
* Discuss and review your code
* Deploy
* Merge

### Explore Git branch model for continuous delivery

One thing: There's no right or wrong, a perfect branching strategy works for your team.

While this chapter explains how to use git and the branching strategy described above, I believe this is already fully explained. The only thing I want to discuss are Azure DevOps commands. See also [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/pull-requests?view=azure-devops&tabs=azure-devops-cli).

Configure your Azure DevOps CLI for your organization and project. Replace organization and project name

```CMD
az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/organization project="project name"
```

Create a new pull request (using the Azure DevOps CLI) to review the changes in the feature-1 branch

```CMD
az repos pr create --title "Review Feature-1 before merging to main" --work-items 38 39 `
    --description "#Merge feature-1 to main" `
    --source-branch feature/myFeature-1 --target-branch main `
    --repository myWebApp --open
```

### Explore fork workflow

Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the "central" codebase, the **fork workflow** gives every developer their server-side repository. It means that each contributor has two Git repositories:

* A private local.
* A public server-side.

A typical workflow looks something like this:

* A developer 'forks' an 'official' server-side repository. It creates their server-side copy.
* The new server-side copy is cloned to their local system.
* A Git remote path for the 'official' repository is added to the local clone.
* A new local feature branch is created.
* The developer makes changes to the new branch.
* New commits are created for the changes.
* The branch gets pushed to the developer's server-side copy.
* The developer opens a pull request from the new branch to the 'official' repository.
* The pull request gets approved for merge and is merged into the original server-side repository.

To integrate the feature into the official codebase:

* The maintainer pulls the contributor's changes into their local repository.
* Checks to make sure it doesn't break the project.
* Merges it into their local main branch.
* Pushes the main branch to the official repository on the server.

Note: Forked repositories are created using the standard *git clone* command. Forked repositories are generally "server-side clones" managed and hosted by a Git service provider such as Azure Repos.

## Collaborate with pull requests in Azure Repos

Let's describe pull requests for collaboration and code reviews using Azure DevOps and GitHub mobile for pull request approvals.

### Collaborate with pull requests

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository.

The keys to great feedback in a pull request are:

* Have the right people review the pull request.
* Make sure that reviewers know what the code does.
* Give actionable, constructive feedback.
* Reply to comments promptly.

There are a few critical branches in your repo that the team relies on always in suitable shapes, such as your main branch. Require pull requests to make any changes on these branches with **branch policies**. Developers pushing changes directly to the protected branches will have their pushes rejected.

### Examine GitHub mobile for pull request approvals

Using a mobile app in combination with Git is a convenient option, particularly when urgent pull request approvals are required.

* The app can render markdown, images, and PDF files directly on the mobile device.
* Pull requests can be managed within the app, along with marking files as viewed, collapsing files.
* Comments can be added.
* Emoji short codes are rendered.
