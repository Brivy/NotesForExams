# Explore non-relational data in Azure

Let's see how that relation stuff works in the third chapter.

## Explore non-relational data in Azure the chapter

This chapter will describe the key characteristics of non-relational databases.

### Explore Azure blob storage

*Azure Blob Storage* is a service that enables you to store massive amounts of unstructured data as binary large objects, or blobs, in the cloud.

If you store a blob on Azure, you store it inside a **container**. This way, you can organize blobs and control who can access which container. Because they are virtual, you can't perform folder-level operations on it (like bulk operations).

There are three different blob types:

- **Block blobs**: Contains of a set of blocks that can vary in size (max. 100 MB). It can be as large as 50.000 blocks with a maximum size of 4.7 TB. The block is the smallest amount of data that can be read or written as an individual unit. Block blobs are best used to store discrete, large, binary objects that change infrequently.
- **Page blobs**: Organized as a collection of fixed size 512-byte pages. A page blob is optimized to support random read and write operations; you can fetch and store data for a single page if necessary. A page blob can hold up to 8 TB of data. Azure uses page blobs to implement virtual disk storage for virtual machines.
- **Append blobs**: Optimized to support append operations. You can only add blocks to the end of an append blob; updating or deleting existing blocks isn't supported. Each block can vary in size, up to 4 MB. The maximum size of an append blob is just over 195 GB.

It also has three access tiers that can be automatically modified by a **Lifecycle management policy**. These access tiers are as follows:

- **Hot**: Intended for blobs that are accessed frequently.
- **Cool**: Intended for blobs that are accessed infrequently.
- **Archive**: Intended for blobs that are accessed rarely. Blobs in the Archive tier are effectively stored in an offline state. To retrieve a blob from the Archive tier, you must change the access tier to Hot or Cool. The blob will then be rehydrated. You can read the blob only when the rehydration process is complete.

### Explore Azure DataLake Storage Gen2

**Azure Data Lake Store (Gen1) / Data Lake Storage Gen2** is a separate service for hierarchical data storage for analytical data lakes, often used by so-called *big data* analytical solutions that work with structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data stored in files. With Gen2, you can take advantage of the scalability of blob storage and the cost-control of storage tiers, combined with the hierarchical file system capabilities and compatibility with major analytics systems of Azure Data Lake Store.

Systems like Hadoop in *Azure HDInsight, Azure Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics* can mount a distributed file system hosted in Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 and use it to process huge volumes of data. You can enable this by turning on the **Hierarchical Namespace** option of an Azure Storage account. This is a one-way process and so it can't be reverted.

### Explore Azure Files

**Azure Files** is essentially a way to create cloud-based network shares, such as you typically find in on-premises organizations to make documents and other files available to multiple users.

It enables you to share up to 100 TB of data in a single storage account. This data can be distributed across any number of file shares in the account. The maximum size of a single file is 1 TB, but you can set quotas to limit the size of each share below this figure. Currently, it supports up to 2000 concurrent connections per shared file. 

By using *AzCopy* or *Azure File Sync*, you can upload and synchronize your files with Azure. It also offers two performance tiers, where the main difference is that *Standard* is using HDDs and *Premium* is using SSDs. It also supports the two most common network file sharing protocols: SMB (Server Message Block, used across multiple OS's) and NFS (Network File System, used by some Linux and MacOS versions).

### Explore Azure Tables

**Azure Table Storage** is a NoSQL storage solution that makes use of tables containing key/value data items. Each item is represented by a row that contains columns for the data fields that need to be stored.

All rows in a table must have a *unique key* (composed of a partition key and a row key), and when you modify data in a table, a *timestamp column* records the date and time the modification was made. It is usually denormalized and there is no such thing as foreign keys, relationships, etc. To ensure fast access, Azure Table Storage splits a table into partitions. Partitioning is a mechanism for grouping related rows, based on a common property or partition key. Rows that share the same partition key will be stored together. By including the partition key in the search criteria, it will narrow down the volume of data to be examined.

The key in an Azure Table Storage table comprises two elements; *the partition key* that identifies the partition containing the row, and *a row key* that is unique to each row in the same partition. Items in the same partition are stored in row key order. If an application adds a new row to a table, Azure ensures that the row is placed in the correct position in the table. This scheme enables an application to quickly perform point queries that identify a single row, and range queries that fetch a contiguous block of rows in a partition.
